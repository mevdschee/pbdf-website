The Privacy by Design foundation develops and maintains the IRMA
app for privacy-friendly authentication and signing. This happens
without profit and without abuse of personal data. Do you value
this effort? Then you can turn your moral support into financial
support.

On the [Dutch language version](/steun) of this webpage you
make personal contribution to the work of the foundation, via the
(Dutch) online payment system iDeal. For other forms of support
or cooperation, feel free to [contact](/contact-en) us.
