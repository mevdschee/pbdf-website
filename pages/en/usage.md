Below is a list of websites where IRMA can now be used for login.

  * [IRMA-meet](https://irma-meet.nl/) for video calling where 
    participants first have to prove who they are.

  * [Helder.health](https://helder.health/) for medical doctors to
    get access to the dossiers of patients.

  * [Ivido](https://platform.ivido.nl/) a personal health environment for 
    everyone who signs up.

  * [VGZ](https://www.vgz.nl/irma#/) for medical cost declarations by
    representatives.

  * [030 IRMA](https://www.030irma.nl/) for adding personal data to a
    pdf document.

  * [MijnIRMA](https://privacybydesign.foundation/mijnirma/) for
    managing ones own IRMA app and for inspecting its usage.

Undoubtedly, this list is not complete. Please inform us about missing
(stable) IRMA applications (at: irma 'at' privacybydesign.foundation).

There is a separate page for IRMA [demos](/demo-en).

Our *preferred partner* for development and integration of
IRMA-applications is [Tweede Golf](https://tweedegolf.nl/).
